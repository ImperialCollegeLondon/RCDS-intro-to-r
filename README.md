# R Programming

This course provides an introduction to R as a programming language, including: 

- basic calculations
- data structures (vectors, matrices and data frames)
- control structures (if, while and for)
- functions
- importing and working with data
- plotting charts

We will not look at statistical testing or advanced data manipulation, as these are beyond the scope of this introductory course.

Please ensure that you have both R and RStudio installed and working before the course:                                              
* https://www.r-project.org/
* https://rstudio.com 

R and RStudio can also be installed via the Anaconda data science platform: 
* https://www.anaconda.com.
