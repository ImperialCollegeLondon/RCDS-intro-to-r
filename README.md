# R Programming

This course provides an introduction to R as a programming language, including:

- basic calculations
- data structures (vectors, matrices and data frames)
- control structures (if, while and for)
- functions
- importing and working with data
- plotting charts

We will not look at statistical testing or advanced data manipulation, as these are beyond the scope of this introductory course.


## Installing R and RStudio

Please ensure that you have up-to-date versions of both R and RStudio installed and working before the course:                                              
* https://www.r-project.org/
* https://rstudio.com

R and RStudio can also be installed via the Anaconda data science platform:
* https://www.anaconda.com.


## Getting Started

Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file (via the big green button at the top of this page) and unpack it. Windows users should make sure that the files are actually extracted to create a real directory (the folder icon will not have a zip). Use of networked file systems is likely to cause problems with RStudio, so it is advisable to put this directory on your local storage (e.g. your desktop).

Open `r_programming_1.html` in your web browser to get started.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnpinney/r_programming/master?urlpath=rstudio)
